## 📂 Repository Structure
- **incident_analysis/** — analysis of school incident reports  
- **school_directory_exploration/** — exploration of school directory data  
- **database_queries/** — SQL queries executed via Python  
- **database_population/** — cleaned SAT results and upload scripts for PostgreSQL  

- Each folder contains a `README.md` explaining the task, methodology, and results.  
- Jupyter Notebooks document all code and visualizations for reproducibility.  
- `database_population` contains cleaned CSV files and scripts to upload to PostgreSQL.
